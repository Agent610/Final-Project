# React + Vite

#Final-Project

<!-- This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh -->

Hello this is Devin Bhavsar and this is my final project,
Throughout this project the following languages were used: HTML,CSS,Javascript, and React.

Throughout this project the command npm run dev started the application in a web browser.
The purpose of this project is to display news articles using APIs, the purpose of an API is to tell the browser a command for example when a user logs in a request is sent to server telling that a user is attempting to sign in.
