# React + Vite

#Final-Project

Hello this is Devin Bhavsar and this is my final project,
Throughout this project the following languages were used: HTML,CSS,Javascript, and React.

Throughout this project the command npm run dev started the application in a web browser.

When the application is opened the user is allowed to search for articles based off what they put in the search-input field.
This project's purpose is to display news articles using APIs, the purpose of an API is to tell the browser a command for example when a user logs in a request is sent to server telling that a user is attempting to sign in.

When a user wants to sign in the they click on the sign in button IF the user already has an account they can sign in with their login credentials a main difference between the sign in process and the register process is after the user registers a popup confirming that their registration is completed will come along with the option to sign in or close the popup.

When the user is signed in they can search for articles based off what they want to view, a very important feature about this application you DON'T have to have an account to search for articles you just can't save them into your saved news page.
